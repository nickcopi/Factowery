Supports both mouse and keyboard controls. WASD to move around selector, 12345 to buy towers. Q to scrap a tower, C to toggle the output mode, and R to toggle the round robin mode. Kill enemies before they reach the building zone. 
Use drills to mine resources, guns to fire bullets, scrappers to get more scrap, tubes to move resources, and energizers to energize random buildings. Some of these require fuel to operate.

This game is generally pretty cool for being made in 12 hours but takes a bit of playing around to figure out and could use a main menu with some instructions as well as some modes of play. It could also use some art. I kind of want to take this one somewhere further than it is.
